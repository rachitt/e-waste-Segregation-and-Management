# e-waste-Segregation-and-Management
This project uses deep learning techniques for detecting, segregating, and counting electronic waste (e-waste). YOLOv5 is employed for object detection, ResNet for classification, and Streamlit provides an interactive interface. The goal is to support efficient e-waste management, helping reduce environmental impact.
